A murder has occurred in the Perfect Neighbourhood, causing an uproar in the local community. According to the evidence found in the crime scene, the crime took place between 13h-17h on 28
November 2023. The victim was at the time sitting in a couch, back towards the bookshelf. Multiple
wounds were found on the victim, including a gunshot, a hit on the head by a blunt pan, and a knife
stab. Witnesses around the house reported seeing the following people in the vicinity: a tall suited
man with grey hair, a coated woman with red hair, a hooded figure, and the butler Jean and maid
Emilie. The suspect left a half-finished can of soda that had lipstick marks.
The police department are baffled and found that the data concerning the case are too
overwhelming, and the technologies at their disposal are far too outdated and not sufficient to
visualize the facts about the case.
the goal of this Project is to design a new XR investigation tool
