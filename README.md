According to the evidence found in the crime scene, the crime took place between 13h-17h on 28 November 2023. The victim was at the time sitting in a couch, back towards the bookshelf. Multiple wounds were found on the victim, including a gunshot, a hit on the head by a blunt pan, and a knife stab.

Witnesses:
Witnesses around the house reported seeing the following people in the vicinity: a tall suited man with grey hair, a coated woman with red hair, a hooded figure, and the butler Jean and maid Emilie.

Clues:
The suspect left a half-finished can of soda that had lipstick marks.

Challenge:
The police department is baffled and found that the data concerning the case are too overwhelming, and the technologies at their disposal are far too outdated and not sufficient to visualize the facts about the case.

Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to design a new XR investigation tool that will revolutionize the way crime scenes are analyzed, providing a more immersive and effective solution for solving complex cases.
